                        <p>
                            Chemical admixtures are the ingredients in concrete other than portland cement, water, and 
                            aggregate that are added to the mix immediately before or during mixing. Producers use admixtures 
                            primarily to reduce the cost of concrete construction; to modify the properties of hardened 
                            concrete; to ensure the quality of concrete during mixing, transporting, placing, and curing; 
                            and to overcome certain emergencies during concrete operations.<br><br> Admixtures play a vital role 
                            in production of quality concrete and mortars in all segments of the industry – Ready-mix, 
                            Precast and Site-batch.  It is the ingredients in concrete other than cement, water and aggregate 
                            that is added to the mix immediately before or during mixing. Used primarily to reduce the cost 
                            of concrete construction; to modify the properties of hardened concrete; to ensure the quality 
                            of concrete during mixing, transporting, placing, and curing; and to overcome certain emergencies

                        <h4><br>BELOW-GROUND WATERPROOFING</h4>
                        <p>
                            We offer one of the most comprehensive ranges in below-ground waterproofing, providing leak-free 
                            buildings around the world. These systems are manufactured to the highest quality standards 
                            backed by independent test certificates. For below-ground structures where the exterior face of 
                            the structural concrete is inaccessible, the waterproofing must be applied prior to pouring the 
                            concrete. Conventional systems are either loose-laid or self-adhering to the substrate not the 
                            structural concrete, this means there is no seal between the waterproofing and the structural concrete 
                            which can lead to water travelling between the waterproofing and the structure from any leakages 
                            that may occur. BS8102:2009 highlights this problem and recommends that a fully-bonded pre-applied 
                            waterproofing system be used to mitigate this risk. A similar problem occurs where ground settlement takes place.
                        </p>

                        <h4>ABOVE-GROUND WATERPROOFING</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cool roofs, as the name implies, are roofs that heat up very little, thanks to their high capacity to reflect solar radiation and, at the same time, to emit infrared heat energy. They can be an effective solution to the problem of overheating that afflicts individual buildings and urban areas in the summer, mitigating the heat island effect. Synthetic membrane, reduces the roof’s surface temperature thanks to its reflectance and remittance. The same effect can be achieved by applying seamless coating. Flat/sloping roofs that are trafficked can be easily waterproofed by using either a spray or liquid-applied membrane to give seamless protection and rapid return to service times.
                        </p>

                        <h4>WET AREAS</h4>
                        <p>
                            Areas within a building that are supplied with water from its water supply system are vulnerable to potential leakages and
                            subsequent damaged to its structure and interior finishes. These critical applications can be dealt with by using a wide variety of waterproofing products supplied by Northtech, ensuring piece of mind for long term durability and comfort. We offers a full range of wet area waterproofing product systems, manufactured to the highest quality standards backed by independent test certificates.
                        </p>

                        <h4>WATER INDUSTRY</h4>
                        <p>
                            Todays water industry operates sophisticated and costly networks including clean water treatment works and sewage plants,
                            usually run as a public service by a public utility which is owned by local or national government. In some countries, the water
                            industry is regulated with products undergoing extensive approvals certification especially when in contact with potable
                            water. We have many solutions to protect and seal clean and dirty water structures, these systems have proven track

                        <h4>Epoxy 3D Floor</h4>
                        <p>
                            The 3D technology is gaining increasing popularity. Epoxy 3D floor has been used more and more in shopping malls, halls, offices, homes and apartments due to its creativity and high performance. This is the latest fad in the fancy floor world.
                            Epoxy 3D floor installation process involves laying down a layer of self-leveling primer followed by the desired image. This is then treated with a transparent two-component epoxy or polyurethane to give the perfect image depth. A level of protective varnish is the final step.
                            Not like a sticker or painted vinyl that is directly under your feet, the installed epoxy 3D floor gives the perception of depth and is impervious to all sorts of damage that would usually affect floor decorations.

                        <p>
                            Prefabrication is the method of construction which includes assembling components of a structure in a manufacturing or  production site, transporting complete assemblies or partial assemblies to the site where the structure is to be located.  It is combination of good design with modern high performance components and quality controlled manufacturing procedures. This work is carried out in two stages, manufacturing of components in a place other than final location and their erection in position.
                            Prefabricated sections are produced in large quantities in a factory and then shipped to various construction sites. This procedure may allow work to continue despite poor weather conditions and should reduce any waste in time and material at the site. Precast concrete units are cast and hardened before being used for construction. Sometimes builders cast components at the building site and hoist them into place after they harden. This technique permits the speedy erection of structures.

                        <h3>Pre Engineered Structures (PEB)</h3>
                        <p>
                            In structural engineering, a pre-engineered building (PEB) is designed by a PEB supplier or PEB manufacturer, to be fabricated using best suited inventory of raw materials available from all sources and manufacturing methods that can efficiently satisfy a wide range of structural and aesthetic design requirements. Within some geographic industry sectors these buildings are also called Pre-Engineered Metal Buildings (PEMB) or, as is becoming increasingly common due to the reduced amount of pre-engineering involved in custom computer-aided designs, simply Engineered Metal Buildings (EMB).
                            During the 1960s, standardized engineering designs for buildings were first marketed as PEBs. Historically, the primary framing structure of a pre-engineered building is an assembly of I-shaped members, often referred as I-beams. In pre-engineered buildings, the I beams used are usually formed by welding together steel plates to form the I section. The I beams are then field-assembled (e.g. bolted connections) to form the entire frame of the pre-engineered building. Some manufacturers taper the framing members (varying in web depth) according to the local loading effects. Larger plate dimensions are used in areas of higher load effects.
                            Other forms of primary framing can include trusses, mill sections rather than three-plate welded, castellated beams, etc. The choice of economic form can vary depending on factors such as local capabilities (e.g. manufacturing, transportation, construction) and variations in material vs. labour costs.
                            Typically, primary frames are 2D type frames (i.e. may be analyzed using two-dimensional techniques). Advances in computer-aided design technology, materials and manufacturing capabilities have assisted a growth in alternate forms of pre-engineered building such as the tension fabric building and more sophisticated analysis (e.g. three-dimensional) as is required by some building codes.
                            Cold formed Z- and C-shaped members may be used as secondary structural elements to fasten and support the external cladding.
                            Roll-formed profiled steel sheet, wood, tensioned fabric, precast concrete, masonry block, glass curtainwall or other materials may be used for the external cladding of the building.
                            In order to accurately design a pre-engineered building, engineers consider the clear span between bearing points, bay spacing, roof slope, live loads, dead loads, collateral loads, wind uplift, deflection criteria, internal crane system and maximum practical size and weight of fabricated members. Historically, pre-engineered building manufacturers have developed pre-calculated tables for different structural elements in order to allow designers to select the most efficient I beams size for their projects. However, the table selection procedures are becoming rare with the evolution in computer-aided custom designs.
                            While pre-engineered buildings can be adapted to suit a wide variety of structural applications, the greatest economy will be realized when utilising standard details. An efficiently designed pre-engineered building can be lighter than the conventional steel buildings by up to 30%. Lighter weight equates to less steel and a potential price savings in structural framework.
